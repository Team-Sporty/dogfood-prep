- Luis Rosales: Likes debugging and loops / interest in the JavaScript side, wanting to improve with CSS

### Conflict Plan

- **What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**

- If it can’t be resolved between the individuals who are in conflict, we will call a team meeting, talk through the problem, and then resolve it with a majority vote

- **What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**

- Call each other out / tap into the brutal honesty of a kindergartener, as John Cokos said. Will rotate responsibilities, so everyone has a chance

- **How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**

- Be upfront about what you know and don’t know – be honest with yourself and your team

- Accept help and understand that we’re all looking to improve

- **How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**

- See if they need help – check if they need extra support

- Scrum master will take the lead initially on ensuring everyone’s pulling their weight and working well with others

- **How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**

- Ask Audrey (or if she’s not available, a TA) for help

- **How often will you take breaks?**

- As needed – we’ll trust each other to take breaks when necessary

- **What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**

- We’ll be doing our daily check-in, so address it then and come up with a plan, such as allocate more resources / people to it, and extend our hours if necessary

- **How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**

- Slack

- **What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**

- Making space for it during each meeting / setting aside time for open conversation (like what Audrey does at the beginning of class)

- **How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**

- Be encouraging of each other, positive, inclusive, supportive, growth mindset, don’t instantly naysay ideas, honesty
